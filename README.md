# Paneling-Software
Simple paneling software that takes as input a '.stl' file and computes the $C_d$ and $C_L$ coefficients (drag and lift coeff. respectively) at the given attack angle. 
# It uses a ______ model for the aerodynamics

It features also a 3d visualization of the lift and drag vectors on the surface of the body.
